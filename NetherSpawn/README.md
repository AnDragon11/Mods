## Description

A simple mod that allows you to create a new world in the nether instead of the overworld

Upon creating a new world, you need to:


Install the resource pack

Then create a new world

Go to the “More” tab

Click on Datapacks and install the datapack




Go to the “World” tab and select World Type: Nether Spawn

The world generation is normal but the overworld/nether are reversed

Beds dont work, you need the respawn anchor in the nether to change spawnpoint
